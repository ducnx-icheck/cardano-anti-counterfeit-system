# Functional requirements
Indicate importance levels (Example: P0 = Must-have, P1 = Should-have, and P2 = Nice-to-have) and outline what the product or feature must do [cite: 1]

| Priority | Detailed description |
|---|---|
| P0 | QR Code Generation and Association: The system MUST allow manufacturers to generate unique QR codes and associate them with specific product identifiers. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | QR Code Scanning: The mobile application MUST allow users to scan QR codes affixed to products using their device's camera. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | First Scan Detection: The backend system MUST be able to determine if a scanned QR code is being scanned for the first time. This determination MUST rely on data stored on the Cardano blockchain. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | Record First Scan On-Chain: Upon the first scan of a QR code, the backend system MUST record this event on the Cardano blockchain (including a timestamp and the associated QR code). This MUST be done using transaction metadata. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | Subsequent Scan Detection: The backend system MUST be able to determine if a scanned QR code has been scanned previously by checking the Cardano blockchain for prior scan records. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | Provide Verification Result to User: The backend system MUST send a clear verification result ("genuine - first scan" or "counterfeit - already scanned") back to the mobile application. [cite: 2] |
| P0 | Display Verification Result: The mobile application MUST display the verification result clearly to the user. [cite: 2] |
| P1 | Manufacturer Onboarding: The system SHOULD provide a process for manufacturers to register and manage their product information and QR code associations. [cite: 2] |
| P1 | Batch QR Code Generation: The system SHOULD allow manufacturers to generate QR codes in bulk for multiple products. [cite: 2] |
| P1 | Optional Product Information Storage (Off-chain): The backend system SHOULD allow manufacturers to store additional product details (e.g., batch number, manufacturing date) in an off-chain database linked to the QR code. [cite: 2] |
| P1 | Basic Scan History (Mobile App): The mobile application SHOULD allow users to view a basic history of the QR codes they have scanned and the corresponding verification results (stored locally on the device). [cite: 2] |
| P2 | Location Tracking (Optional): The system COULD record the location of the first scan (with user consent) and store this information on the Cardano blockchain or off-chain. [cite: 2] |
| P2 | Manufacturer Dashboard: The system COULD provide a dashboard for manufacturers to view statistics on product tagging and (potentially) scanning activity. [cite: 2] |
| P2 | Advanced Scan History (Mobile App): The mobile application COULD provide more detailed information in the scan history (e.g., date and time of scan). [cite: 2] |
| P2 | Integration with Existing Manufacturer Systems (API): The system COULD provide an API for manufacturers to integrate QR code generation and association directly with their existing product management systems. [cite: 2] |

# Non-functional requirements
## Performance
* Scan Time : The time taken for the mobile application to scan a QR code and send the request to the backend MUST be less than 2 seconds under normal network conditions. [cite: 3]
* Verification Response Time : The time taken for the backend API to process a verification request and send a response back to the mobile application MUST be less than 3 seconds under normal load. [cite: 4]
* Blockchain Write Latency (First Scan) : The time for the first scan transaction to be submitted to the Cardano network SHOULD be within a few seconds, although finality will take longer (as per Cardano network norms). [cite: 5]
* Scalability : The backend system MUST be able to handle 1,000 concurrent scan requests and 10,000,000 number of new product registrations per day. [cite: 6]

## Security
* Authentication : The manufacturer portal MUST require secure authentication for access (e.g., username/password with strong password policies). [cite: 7]
* API Security : The communication between the mobile application and the backend API MUST be secured using HTTPS. [cite: 8]
* API endpoints that require authorization SHOULD be protected (e.g., using API keys or JWT). [cite: 9]
* Data Protection : Sensitive data stored off-chain MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. [cite: 10]
* Blockchain Key Management : Private keys used for signing Cardano transactions MUST be securely stored and managed. [cite: 11]
* Mobile App Security : The mobile application SHOULD follow security best practices to prevent reverse engineering and data leakage. [cite: 12]

## Usability
* Ease of Use (Mobile App) : The mobile application MUST have an intuitive and user-friendly interface for scanning QR codes and viewing verification results. [cite: 13]
* Accessibility (Mobile App) : The mobile application SHOULD adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to be usable by individuals with disabilities (consider font sizes, color contrast, screen reader compatibility). [cite: 14]
* Ease of Use : The manufacturer portal SHOULD have a clear and easy-to-navigate interface for managing products and QR codes. [cite: 15]
* Clear Feedback : The system MUST provide clear and understandable feedback to both manufacturers and consumers. [cite: 16]

## Compatibility
* Mobile Operating Systems : The mobile application MUST be compatible with the latest two major versions of both Android and iOS. [cite: 17]
* Web Browsers : The manufacturer portal SHOULD be compatible with the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). [cite: 18]

# Dependencies
## Internal
* Existing QR Code Management System : This project relies on the existing system for initial QR code generation and product information. [cite: 19]
* Clear APIs or data exchange mechanisms are required. [cite: 20]
* Mobile Development Team : The development of the mobile application is a critical dependency. [cite: 21]
* Backend Development Team : The development of the Backend API and its integration with Cardano is a critical dependency. [cite: 21]
* Infrastructure Team : Provisioning and managing the server infrastructure for the Backend API and off-chain database. [cite: 22]

## External
* Cardano Blockchain : The core functionality relies on the availability and stability of the Cardano Mainnet. [cite: 23]
* Cardano Node API or Third-Party API Service : Primary dependency on Blockfrost (Enterprise Plan). [cite: 24]
* Backup options include Koios or self-hosted node setup to ensure service continuity in case of failure or API limitations. [cite: 25]
* Operating System APIs : Access to device camera and network functionalities. [cite: 26]

# Assumptions
* The existing QR code management system can provide necessary data for integration. [cite: 27]
* Users will have internet connectivity when scanning QR codes for verification. [cite: 28]
* The Cardano Mainnet will remain stable and operational. [cite: 28]
* Third-party Cardano API services (if used) will be reliable. [cite: 29]
* Manufacturers will affix the provided QR codes to their genuine products. [cite: 29]

# Risks and mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation Plan |
|---|---|
| Integration challenges with the existing QR code system | Thorough assessment of the existing system's capabilities and early development of integration APIs/mechanisms. Have contingency plans for manual data transfer if needed. [cite: 31] |
| Scalability issues with the Backend API | Design the Backend API with scalability in mind (e.g., microservices architecture, load balancing). Conduct performance testing under anticipated load. [cite: 31] |
| Security vulnerabilities in the mobile app or backend | Implement robust security measures throughout the development lifecycle, including code reviews, penetration testing, and secure key management practices. [cite: 31] |
| High transaction fees on Cardano | Implement batching of transactions to reduce overall costs. Optimize the data being written on-chain. Monitor Cardano network fees. [cite: 31] |
| Unreliable third-party Cardano API service | Monitoring and failover mechanisms. Consider using multiple API providers or running our own Cardano node as a backup (if resources allow). [cite: 31] |
| User adoption challenges (manufacturers and consumers) | Develop clear and compelling value propositions for both user groups. Provide comprehensive onboarding documentation and support. Design a user-friendly mobile application. [cite: 31] |
| Delays in Cardano network upgrades | Stay informed about upcoming Cardano network upgrades and plan for any necessary adjustments to the system. Conduct thorough testing after upgrades. [cite: 31] |
| Key loss for signing Cardano transactions | Implement a robust and secure key management system with multiple layers of security and backup mechanisms. [cite: 31] |
| Legal compliance issues related to user data | Ensure full compliance with applicable data protection regulations. Clearly inform users and obtain explicit consent before collecting any personal data such as location. Provide mechanisms to opt out and delete personal data upon request. [cite: 31] |

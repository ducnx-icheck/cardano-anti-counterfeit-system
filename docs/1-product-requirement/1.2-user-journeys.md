## Journey 1: Manufacturer Onboarding and Product Tagging

* **Persona**: Sarah, a Production Manager at a mid-sized clothing company.
* **Goal**: Her goal is to protect her brand from increasing counterfeit products and provide assurance to her customers.
* **User**: New Manufacturer
* **Task**: Integrate the anti-counterfeit system into their production process and tag their products.

**Steps:**

1.  **Discovery**: Sarah learns about the anti-counterfeit system through industry news or a sales outreach.
2.  **Information Gathering**: Sarah visits the system's website to understand its features, benefits, and pricing.
3.  **Registration/Account Creation**: Sarah signs up for an account, providing company details.
4.  **System Integration Assessment**: Sarah reviews the integration documentation or consults with the system's support team to understand how to connect their product database or generate QR codes.
5.  **QR Code Generation/Integration Setup**: Sarah either generates QR codes in bulk through the system's platform or sets up an API integration to automatically generate QR codes for new product SKUs.
6.  **Printing and Application**: Sarah's team prints the generated QR codes onto product labels or packaging.
7.  **Product Information Association (Optional)**: Sarah may associate additional product details (batch number, manufacturing date) with the QR codes within the system's backend.
8.  **Testing**: Sarah scans a few tagged products using a test version of the consumer app to ensure the system works correctly.
9.  **Deployment**: Sarah rolls out the QR code tagging to all new product lines.
10. **Monitoring (Optional)**: Sarah may use the system's dashboard to track the number of tagged products and (potentially) first scans.

## Journey 2: Consumer Verifying Product Authenticity (First Scan)

* **Persona**: David, a tech-savvy consumer who has purchased a product with the anti-counterfeit QR code.
* **Goal**: His goal is to ensure he has bought a genuine item.
* **User**: New Consumer
* **Task**: Verify the authenticity of a newly purchased product for the first time.

**Steps:**

1.  **Product Purchase**: David buys a product with the anti-counterfeit QR code.
2.  **QR Code Discovery**: David notices the QR code on the product label or packaging.
3.  **App Download (If Necessary)**: If David doesn't have the app, he downloads it from the app store (guided by instructions near the QR code).
4.  **App Launch**: David opens the anti-counterfeit verification app.
5.  **Scan Initiation**: David taps the "Scan QR Code" button.
6.  **QR Code Scan**: David points his phone's camera at the QR code.
7.  **Data Transmission**: The app sends the scanned QR code value to the Backend API.
8.  **Verification Process (Backend)**: The Backend API checks the Cardano blockchain for any record of this QR code being scanned before.
    * Since it's the first scan, no record is found. The API then records this scan (timestamp, potentially location) on the Cardano blockchain.
9.  **Result Display**: The app receives the "genuine - first scan" result from the Backend API and displays a clear confirmation message to David.
10. **Confirmation**: David feels confident that his product is genuine.

## Journey 3: Consumer Verifying Product Authenticity (Subsequent Scan)

* **Persona**: Emily, a consumer who is considering buying a second-hand product with the anti-counterfeit QR code.
* **Goal**: Her goal is to check if the product has been previously verified, which might indicate it's not genuine if scanned multiple times.
* **User**: Returning Consumer
* **Task**: Verify the authenticity of a product that might have been scanned before.

**Steps:**

1.  **Product Encounter**: Emily finds a second-hand product with the anti-counterfeit QR code.
2.  **App Launch**: Emily opens the anti-counterfeit verification app.
3.  **Scan Initiation**: Emily taps the "Scan QR Code" button.
4.  **QR Code Scan**: Emily points her phone's camera at the QR code.
5.  **Data Transmission**: The app sends the scanned QR code value to the Backend API.
6.  **Verification Process (Backend)**: The Backend API checks the Cardano blockchain and finds a record of this QR code being scanned previously.
7.  **Result Display**: The app receives the "counterfeit - already scanned" result from the Backend API and displays a warning message to Emily.
8.  **Decision**: Emily is now aware that the product might not be genuine due to the prior scan.

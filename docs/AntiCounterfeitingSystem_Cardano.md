# Product requirements: Anti-Counterfeiting System Integrating with Cardano Blockchain


## Introduction

### Purpose

To build an advanced anti-counterfeit QR code management system leveraging the transparency and immutability of the Cardano blockchain to verify the origin and authenticity of products, thereby protecting consumers and the reputation of manufacturers.
Problem statement
The market is rife with counterfeit goods, causing significant harm to both consumers (financial loss, substandard products) and manufacturers (reputational damage, reduced revenue). Existing anti-counterfeit solutions are often unreliable or easily falsified.
Target audience
Manufacturers: Businesses producing goods who want to protect their brand, combat counterfeiting, and provide consumers with a tool to verify genuine products. They need a user-friendly system capable of integrating with existing production processes and providing product tracking information.
Consumers: End-buyers who want a simple, fast, and trustworthy way to verify the authenticity of a product before or after purchase. They need an easy-to-use mobile application that provides clear information about the product's origin and history.


Objectives
Goals
Enhance anti-counterfeiting capabilities: Provide a stronger layer of protection for products by recording authentication information on the Cardano blockchain.
Increase consumer confidence: Empower buyers with the ability to easily self-verify the authenticity of products.
Protect brand reputation: Help manufacturers safeguard their brand and minimize damage caused by counterfeit goods.
Provide product tracking data (optional): Allow manufacturers to track the journey of their products (first scan).
Facilitate easy integration: Ensure the system can be easily integrated with manufacturers' existing product management systems and production processes.
Non-goals
Not focused on direct physical anti-counterfeiting solutions on the product itself (e.g., complex holograms).
Does not include complex inventory management or logistics features beyond tracking the first scan.
Does not address counterfeit goods in unofficial distribution channels without the system's QR code.
Does not integrate with blockchains other than Cardano in the initial version.


Metrics
Quantitative:
Number of manufacturers registered and using the system within 3 months.
Number of products tagged with the system's QR codes within 3 months.
Average number of QR code scans per product within 3 months.
Percentage of mobile application users who successfully perform a scan.
Average time for users to receive verification results after scanning.
Reduction in reported counterfeit incidents for products using the system (requires pre- and post-implementation data collection).
Qualitative:
Manufacturer feedback on the system's ease of use and effectiveness (via surveys, interviews).
Consumer feedback on the mobile application user experience and the reliability of the verification information (via surveys, app store reviews).
Assessment by customer support regarding the number and type of inquiries related to product verification.
Level of consumer awareness and trust in the new anti-counterfeit system.

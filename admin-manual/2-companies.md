The system will send account information to the email entered earlier with the registered information.  
The company logs in to the email and follows the instructions to log in to the **qrcheck system**.

If the login account is a number that does not exist in the **iCheck system**, an account will be automatically created with any password.  
This account will be sent to the company's email.

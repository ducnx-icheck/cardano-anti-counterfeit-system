The system will automatically send account credentials to the email address entered during registration.  
The agency must check their email and follow the instructions to log in to the **qrcheck system**.

If the login account is a number that does not exist in the **iCheck system**, an account will be automatically created with any password.  
This account will be sent to the agent's email.  

If the login account is an existing account number in the **iCheck system**, the agent can log in with that account.
